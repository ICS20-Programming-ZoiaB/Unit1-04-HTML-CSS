    <h1>The benefits of sleep on a developing mind</h1>
    <p>Why is sleep so crucial?</p>
      <ul>
  <li>Sleep boosts the immune system, thus helping you get sick less often. </li>
  <li>Getting adequate sleep reduces stress, which improves your mood and fuels healthy choices.</li>
  <li>There is shown to be a correlation between number of hours slept and academic scores. Overall, the more sleep the students had, the more highly they scored on standardized mathematics tests.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Here is a table showing the positive correlation of sleep and academic achievement:</p>
    <table border=1>
  <tr>
    <th>Hours of sleep:</th>
    <th>Average score (percentage) on math test:</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9 hours</td>
    <td>91%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8 hours</td>
    <td>83%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
